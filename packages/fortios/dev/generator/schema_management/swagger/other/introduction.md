FortiOS - Introduction
Welcome to the FortiOS REST API!
The FortiOS REST API allows you to perform configuration and monitoring operations on a FortiGate appliance or VM. The following types of REST APIs are supported:

Configuration APIs retrieve and modify CLI configuration items. For example, create or delete a firewall policy; view or change system settings.

Monitor APIs retrieve dynamic data and perform system/network operations. For example, restart or shut down a FortiGate; backup or restore configuration settings.

Log APIs Log APIs retrieve/download traffic and event logs from different sources (FortiGate disk, FortiGate memory, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiGate Cloud).

Supported APIs are grouped by FortiOS version in the left navigation tree. Select an API and all supported methods will be displayed. The default model for which APIs are displayed is the FG-60/61E. To change the FortiGate model, click the gear icon (Config-cps.png) to launch the configuration popup and then select the Model tab.

Communicate with the FortiOS REST API through your web browser or by using the Try it out feature of the Fortinet Developer Network (FNDN). Try it out has an easy to use interactive interface that allows you to build requests which are then sent to your FortiGate.

This Tutorial will give you hands-on experience with both of these methods.
