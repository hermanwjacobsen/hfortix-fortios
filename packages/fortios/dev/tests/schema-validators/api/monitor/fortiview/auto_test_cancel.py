# This endpoint is a category container or action endpoint with sub-endpoints.
# It does not have direct GET/POST methods but provides access to sub-actions.
# 
# Auto-generated tests only cover safe, read-only GET operations.
# Write operations require careful manual testing with proper setup/teardown.
#
# Available sub-endpoints can be accessed via this category object.
# Refer to the API documentation for available actions.
#
# To test this endpoint, create manual tests in test_cancel.py
